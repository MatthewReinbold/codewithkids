# Introduction to Code Club

## Equipment Needed
* Raspberry Pi version B (~$40)
* A SD Card (8 GB or larger Recommended) ($7 new)

A keyboard, mouse, network connectivity, and power for the Raspberry Pi will be provided. I will attempt to provide as many monitors as possible so that each kid has one, but any extras are welcome.

##  Rough Outline of Activities - Fall 2014

The agenda below is what we expect to be doing. However, what we do is, ultimately, determined by the group's interests. *If there is an area that the kids believe will be more fun while furthering their joy of creating*, we'll pursue it.

#### Discovery (15-20 minutes)
* The incredible [shrinking computer](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/79094537175963339/) 
* [Introduction to the Raspberry Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wkVVVLvR8). More detail [is available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBRkErt6VXU).
* The long tradition of computer case modding ([ex 1](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/529876712380790562/), [ex 2](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/250090585529358442/), [ex 3](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/343610646541807458/), [ex 4](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/51580358206894244/), [ex 5](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/546061523540880885/), [ex 6](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/235735361715566971/))
* Examples of Raspberry Pi Lego cases ([ex 1](http://makethingsdostuff.co.uk/project/build-raspberry-pi-case-out-lego),[ex 2](http://www.instructables.com/id/Lego-Raspberry-Pi-Case/?ALLSTEPS),[ex 3](https://ideas.lego.com/projects/35363), [ex 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwFnJuxAuM)) - It's not just for toys, either! Check out [a Raspberry Pi/Lego **supercomputer**](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~sjc/raspberrypi/).


#### Collaborative Play (~ hour)
Each participant needs to bring a collection of their own Lego pieces. These will be used to build a customized Raspberry Pi case. This case will protect their computer.

### Oct. 1st - "Hello World"
Using the Raspberry Pi kids will not only being logging their activities, but writing the tools to do the logging. Kids will receive their [Raspbian OS](http://www.raspbian.org/) with [Google Coder](http://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder/) (an interactive HTML/CSS/JS development environment that runs in a browser) pre-installed on SD cards. 

#### Discovery (30 minutes)
